# Open this file:
classroom/lessons/TEACHER_SETUP_One_Hundred_Eighty.md
Set up your class repository:

# Navigate to your class repository
cd ~/path/to/your/class-repo

# Create lesson folder structure
mkdir -p Unit-Angles-Proof/Lesson-One-Hundred-Eighty

# Copy templates
cp ~/learning/classroom/lessons/templates/*.md Unit-Angles-Proof/Lesson-One-Hundred-Eighty/

# Commit and push
git add Unit-Angles-Proof/
git commit -m "Lesson setup: One Hundred Eighty ready for students"
git push origin main
Gather physical materials:

Triangle with 50°, 60°, 70° angles (one per student/pair)
Class reference chart display
Digital applets (optional)
Tomorrow in Class:
Opening (5 min):

Display on board:
BEFORE WE START:
1. cd ~/Documents/ClassWork/geometry-class
2. git pull origin main
3. cd Unit-Angles-Proof/Lesson-One-Hundred-Eighty
4. Open Warmup-What-Went-Wrong.md
During Lesson (50 min):

Follow the timeline in TEACHER_SETUP guide
Monitor commits: git log --all --since="10 min ago"
Students commit after each activity
Help with Git questions
