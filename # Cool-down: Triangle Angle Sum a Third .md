## Instructions

 

**Time:** 5 minutes

**Work:** Individual (this is your exit ticket!)

**Task:** Prove the Triangle Angle Sum Theorem using a THIRD method (different from Activities 1 and 2)

 

---

 

## The Triangle

 

**Draw any triangle:**

 

```

[Your triangle here]

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Label it with vertices A, B, C

```

## My Proof (Method 3)

 

### Given:

Triangle ABC with angles ∠A, ∠B, and ∠C

 

---

 

### To Prove:

m∠A + m∠B + m∠C = 180°

 

---

 

### Proof:

 

**Step 1:**

 

 

 

 

 

 

**Step 2:**

 

 

 

 

 

 

**Step 3:**

 

 

 

 

 

 

**Step 4:** (if needed)

 

 

 

 

 

 

**Step 5:** (if needed)

## Reflection

 

### Which of the three methods makes the most sense to me?

- [ ] Method 1 (Activity 1): _________________

- [ ] Method 2 (Activity 2): _________________

- [ ] Method 3 (Cool-down): _________________

 

**Why?**

### Do I feel confident I could prove this for ANY triangle?

- [ ] Yes, definitely

- [ ] Somewhat confident

- [ ] Not yet - I need more practice
