## Triangle Information

 

**Vertices:** A, B, C

 

```

[Draw or describe your triangle here]

 

 

 

 

```

 

**Given information:**

- Triangle ABC with angles ∠A, ∠B, and ∠C

- No specific angle measures (this proof works for ANY triangle!)

 

---

 

## My Proof (Method 1: Auxiliary Line)

 

**Strategy:** I will use an auxiliary line (a helper line) parallel to one side of the triangle.

 

### Step 1: Draw the auxiliary line

**What I did:**

 

 

 

 

**Why this is valid (what theorem/postulate allows this?):**

### Step 2: Identify angle relationships

**What I did:**

 

 

 

 

**Why this is valid:**

 

 

 

 

**What theorem(s) am I using?**

### Step 3: Set up an equation

**What I did:**

 

 

 

 

**Why this is valid:**

 

 

 

 

---

 

### Step 4: Substitute and simplify

**What I did:**

 

 

 

 

**Why this is valid:**

### Step 5: Conclusion

**What I did:**

 

 

 

 

**Therefore:** m∠A + m∠B + m∠C = _______°

## My Reasoning

 

**In my own words, WHY does this proof work?**

 

 

 

 

 

 

**Why does this proof work for ANY triangle, not just this one?**

 

 

 

 

 

 

**The key insight of this proof is:**
