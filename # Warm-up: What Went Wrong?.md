## The Triangle

 

```

      A

     /\

    /  \

   /    \

  /      \

 /________\

B          C

 

Given angles:

∠A = 50°

∠B = 60°

∠C = 70°

```

 

---

 

## Given Proof (Contains Errors!)

 

**Student's Claim:** "I can prove that the angles in this triangle add up to 180°."

 

**Their Proof:**

 

**Step 1:** The angles in the triangle are 50°, 60°, and 70°.

 

**Step 2:** I added them: 50 + 60 + 70 = 180

 

**Step 3:** Since these three angles add to 180°, I have proven that ALL triangles have angles that sum to 180°.

 

**Conclusion:** The Triangle Angle Sum Theorem is proven! ✓
