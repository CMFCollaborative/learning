## Challenge Problem: Quadrilateral Angle Sum

**Question:** If the angles in a triangle sum to 180°, what do the angles in a quadrilateral (4-sided figure) sum to?

### Part 1: Make a Conjecture

**My guess:** The angles in a quadrilateral sum to _______°

**My reasoning for this guess:**





---

### Part 2: Test Your Conjecture

**Draw a quadrilateral:** (any 4-sided figure)

```
[Draw your quadrilateral here]






```

**Measure or assign angles:**
∠1 = _____°
∠2 = _____°
∠3 = _____°
∠4 = _____°

**Sum:** _____ + _____ + _____ + _____ = _______°

**Does this match my conjecture?**
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No - I need to revise!

---

### Part 3: Prove It!

**Can you use what you learned about triangles to PROVE the quadrilateral angle sum?**

**Hint:** How could you split a quadrilateral into triangles?

**My proof:**







**Diagram showing my strategy:**
```
[Draw how you split the quadrilateral]








```

**My equation:**




**Therefore, the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is** _______°

### Part 4: Generalize

**What about a pentagon (5 sides)?**

**My conjecture:** _______°

**My reasoning:**





---

**Can you find a pattern?**

| Shape | Sides | Angle Sum | Pattern |
|-------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Triangle | 3 | 180° | |
| Quadrilateral | 4 | _____° | |
| Pentagon | 5 | _____° | |
| Hexagon | 6 | _____° | |
| n-gon | n | _____° | |

**The formula for an n-sided polygon:**

### Part 5: Challenge Your Understanding

**Why does this pattern work?**






**Could you prove this works for ANY polygon?**
