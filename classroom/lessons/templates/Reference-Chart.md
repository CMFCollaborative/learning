### Lesson: One Hundred Eighty (Triangle Angle Sum Theorem)

**Theorem Statement:**

**Triangle Angle Sum Theorem:** The sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is 180°.

**Symbolic notation:**
For any triangle ABC: m∠A + m∠B + m∠C = 180°

---

**Proof Methods I Know:**

**Method 1 (Auxiliary Line):**
- Draw a line parallel to one side through the opposite vertex
- Use alternate interior angles
- Show angles form a straight line (180°)

**Method 2 (______________________):**
*(Fill in the method you used in Activity 2)*




**Method 3 (______________________):**
*(Fill in the method you used in Cool-down)*




**Which method I prefer:**

**Why:**

**Key Vocabulary:**

| Term | Definition | Example/Diagram |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| **Auxiliary line** | A line added to a diagram to help with a proof | |
| **Alternate interior angles** | | |
| **Linear pair** | | |
| | | |

---

**When to use this theorem:**

- Finding a missing angle in a triangle when two angles are known
- Checking if three angles can form a triangle
- Proving other angle relationships
-


**Examples:**

Example 1: If ∠A = 50° and ∠B = 60°, then ∠C = ______°
*Solution:*




Example 2: Can a triangle have angles of 90°, 45°, and 50°?
*Solution:*

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

1. Assuming one example proves it for all triangles
2.
3.

## Quick Reference: Angle Relationships

*(Add to this as you learn more)*

| Relationship | Diagram | Properties | When to Use |
|--------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Linear Pair** | | Sum to 180° | |
| **Vertical Angles** | | Equal measures | |
| **Alternate Interior** | | Equal (if lines parallel) | |
| **Corresponding** | | | |
| | | | |

## Problem-Solving Strategies

**When I see a triangle with missing angles:**
1. Check what angles I know
2. Use Triangle Angle Sum: sum = 180°
3. Set up equation
4. Solve

**When I need to prove something:**
1. Identify what I'm trying to prove
2. Look for helpful relationships (parallel lines, etc.)
3. Consider adding auxiliary lines
4. Justify each step
5. Write clear conclusion
