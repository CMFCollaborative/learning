## Overview

Now you'll apply MULTIPLE theorems to solve complex problems:
- Triangle Angle Sum Theorem (from last lesson)
- Alternate Interior Angles Theorem
- Corresponding Angles Theorem
- Same-Side Interior Angles Theorem

**Strategy:** Work step-by-step, justify each step with a theorem!

### Check My Work

**Do all the angles make sense?**
- [ ] Alternate interior angles are congruent ✓
- [ ] Corresponding angles are congruent ✓
- [ ] Same-side interior angles sum to 180° ✓
- [ ] Linear pairs sum to 180° ✓

## Problem 2: Triangle in a Transversal Diagram

### The Diagram

```
[Diagram showing:
- Two parallel lines l and m
- Transversal t creates a triangle
- One angle of the triangle is marked 45°
- Find all angles in the triangle and around it]













```

---

### Given Information

- l ∥ m
- ∠A = 45° (one angle in the triangle)
- The triangle is formed by the parallel lines and transversal

---

### Find the Triangle's Angles

**∠A = 45°** (given)

**∠B = ____°**

**My work:**
- First, I need to find _______
- Using ____________ theorem:
- Therefore, ∠B = ____°

---

**∠C = ____°**

**My work:**
- Now I can use Triangle Angle Sum Theorem!
- ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
- 45° + ___° + ∠C = 180°
- ∠C = ____°

---

### Check Using Another Method

**Can I find ∠C a different way using transversal theorems?**

**Alternative method:**




**Result:** ∠C = ____°

**Does it match?**
- [ ] Yes! ✓
- [ ] No - I need to find my error

## Problem 3: Proof with Multiple Theorems

### The Challenge

**Given:**
- Lines l and m are parallel (l ∥ m)
- Transversal t intersects both lines
- Point P is where the transversal meets line l
- Point Q is where the transversal meets line m
- Point R is on line l, creating triangle PQR

**Prove:** ∠QPR + ∠PQR + ∠QRP = 180°

*(This proves that we can use both transversal theorems AND triangle angle sum together!)*
