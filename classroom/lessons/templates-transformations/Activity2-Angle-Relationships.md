# Activity 2: Other Angle Relationships
**Name:** _________________
**Date:** _________________
**Lesson:** Transformations, Transversals and Proof

---

## Overview

In Activity 1, we proved that **alternate interior angles** are congruent.

Now we'll prove relationships for:
1. Corresponding angles
2. Same-side interior angles (also called consecutive interior angles)

---

## Relationship 1: Corresponding Angles

### Identifying Corresponding Angles

**Corresponding angles** are:
- On the SAME side of the transversal
- One is INTERIOR, one is EXTERIOR
- One is ABOVE the top parallel line, the other is ABOVE the bottom parallel line (or both below)
- Form an "F" pattern or backwards "F"

**In my diagram from Activity 1:**

```

**Corresponding angle pairs are:**

Pair 1: ∠___ and ∠___
Pair 2: ∠___ and ∠___
Pair 3: ∠___ and ∠___
Pair 4: ∠___ and ∠___

### My Conjecture

**I think corresponding angles are:** (check one)
- [ ] Congruent (equal)
- [ ] Supplementary (sum to 180°)
- [ ] Neither

**My reasoning:**

### Proof: Corresponding Angles Theorem

**Theorem:** If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then corresponding angles are congruent.

**Given:** l ∥ m, transversal t

**Prove:** ∠___ ≅ ∠___ (choose one pair of corresponding angles)

**My Proof:**

**Strategy:** I will use what I know about alternate interior angles and other angle relationships.

### Practice with Corresponding Angles

```

If ∠1 = 73° and ∠1 and ∠5 are corresponding angles, then:

∠5 = ____°

**Justification:**

## Relationship 2: Same-Side Interior Angles

### Identifying Same-Side Interior Angles

**Same-side interior angles** (also called consecutive interior angles) are:
- On the SAME side of the transversal
- Both INTERIOR (between the parallel lines)
- Form a "C" pattern or backwards "C"

**In my diagram:**

**Same-side interior angle pairs are:**

Pair 1: ∠___ and ∠___
Pair 2: ∠___ and ∠___

---

### My Conjecture

**I think same-side interior angles are:** (check one)
- [ ] Congruent (equal)
- [ ] Supplementary (sum to 180°)
- [ ] Neither

**My reasoning:**




**Test my conjecture:**
If ∠3 = 110°, and ∠3 and ∠5 are same-side interior angles, then:
∠5 = ____°
∠3 + ∠5 = ____°

---

### Proof: Same-Side Interior Angles Theorem

**Theorem:** If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then same-side interior angles are supplementary.

**Given:** l ∥ m, transversal t

**Prove:** ∠___ + ∠___ = 180° (choose one pair)

---

**My Proof:**

**Strategy:** I will use:
- [ ] Alternate interior angles theorem (from Activity 1)
- [ ] Linear pairs
- [ ] Triangle Angle Sum Theorem (from last lesson!)
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Step 1:**

**Step 3:**

### Practice with Same-Side Interior Angles

```
[Diagram with parallel lines and transversal]
```

If ∠3 = 68° and ∠3 and ∠5 are same-side interior angles, then:

∠5 = ____°

**Work:**
∠3 + ∠5 = 180° (same-side interior angles are supplementary)
68° + ∠5 = 180°
∠5 = ____°

## Summary Table

| Angle Relationship | Location | Are they... | Pattern |
|-------------------|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Alternate Interior** | Opposite sides, interior | Congruent | Z or backwards Z |
| **Corresponding** | Same side, one interior/one exterior | Congruent | F or backwards F |
| **Same-Side Interior** | Same side, both interior | Supplementary | C or backwards C |

## Comparing Relationships

### How are these theorems connected?

**If I know alternate interior angles are congruent, can I prove corresponding angles are congruent?**




**If I know alternate interior angles are congruent, can I prove same-side interior angles are supplementary?**




**Which theorem is the "foundation" that others depend on?**




---

### Using Multiple Theorems Together

**Problem:** Find the missing angle.
