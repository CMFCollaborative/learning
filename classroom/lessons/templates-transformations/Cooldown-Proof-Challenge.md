# Cool-down: Proof Challenge
**Name:** _________________
**Date:** _________________
**Lesson:** Transformations, Transversals and Proof

---

## Instructions

**Time:** 5 minutes
**Work:** Individual (this is your exit ticket!)
**Task:** Find all missing angles using the theorems from BOTH lessons

---

## The Problem

```
Diagram:
- Two parallel lines l and m
- Transversal t intersects both
- A triangle is formed
- One angle is marked: 52°

[Draw or paste diagram here]













```

---

## Given:

- l ∥ m (lines l and m are parallel)
- Transversal t intersects l at point A and m at point B
- Point C is on line m, forming triangle ABC
- ∠CAB = 52°

---

## Find:

All missing angles labeled in the diagram:
- ∠ABC = ?
- ∠BCA = ?
- ∠1 = ? (angle above ∠CAB)
- ∠2 = ? (corresponding angle to ∠ABC)
- ∠3 = ? (same-side interior angle with ∠ABC)

## Check My Work

**Verify using Triangle Angle Sum:**
∠CAB + ∠ABC + ∠BCA = ___° + ___° + ___° = ____°

**Should equal 180°:**
- [ ] Yes! ✓
- [ ] No - I need to find my error

**Verify angle relationships:**
- Corresponding angles are equal: ___
- Same-side interior angles sum to 180°: ___
- Alternate interior angles are equal: ___

### Self-Assessment: Readiness for Mastery Check

**Do I feel ready for the mastery check?**
- [ ] Yes, definitely! I understand both lessons and can apply the theorems
- [ ] Somewhat - I understand most but want to review ___________
- [ ] Not yet - I need more practice with ___________

**What I need to review before the mastery check:**




**Questions I still have:**

### Looking Back at Both Lessons

**Lesson: One Hundred Eighty**
- I learned: Triangle Angle Sum Theorem (angles in triangle = 180°)
- Confidence level: ___/5

**Lesson: Transformations, Transversals**
- I learned: Angle relationships with parallel lines and transversals
- Confidence level: ___/5

**Using them together:**
- I can apply multiple theorems in one problem
- Confidence level: ___/5

---

## Next Steps

**If you feel ready for the mastery check:**
- Review your Reference Chart
- Look over your work from both lessons
- Tag yourself as ready (see below)

**If you need more practice:**
- Review activities from both lessons
- Ask your teacher for extra practice problems
- Work with a study group (use peer collaboration branch!)

**IMPORTANT: Submit this as your exit ticket!**

```bash
git add Cooldown-Proof-Challenge.md
git commit -m "Cool-down: Completed proof challenge (EXIT TICKET)"
git tag -a lesson-transformations-complete-$(date +%Y%m%d) -m "Lesson complete"
git push origin main --tags
```

---

## Optional: Signal Readiness for Mastery Check

**If you feel ready to take the mastery check**, add this tag:

```bash
git tag -a mastery-angles-proof-ready -m "Ready for Angles and Proof mastery check"
git push origin --tags
```

**Your teacher will:**
1. Review your work from BOTH lessons
2. Check your cool-downs and activities
3. Confirm you're ready or suggest review areas
4. Give you access to the mastery check when ready!
