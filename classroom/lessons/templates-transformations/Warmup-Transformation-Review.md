## Transformation Properties

### Translation (Slide)

**What is a translation?**




**Does it preserve angle measures?**
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

**Example:** Describe what happens to angle measures when you slide a triangle:




**Diagram:**
```
[Draw or describe a translation]




```

### Rotation (Turn)

**What is a rotation?**




**Does it preserve angle measures?**
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

**Example:** Describe what happens to angle measures when you rotate a triangle:




**Diagram:**
```
[Draw or describe a rotation]




```

### Reflection (Flip)

**What is a reflection?**




**Does it preserve angle measures?**
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

**Example:** Describe what happens to angle measures when you reflect a triangle:




**Diagram:**
```
[Draw or describe a reflection]




```

## Summary of Rigid Transformations

**Which transformations preserve (keep the same):**

| Property | Translation | Rotation | Reflection |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Angle measures | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No |
| Side lengths | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No |
| Shape | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No |
| Orientation | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No |

## Connection to Angles

**Why does it matter that transformations preserve angle measures?**




**How can transformations help us prove angle relationships?**




**Preview:** Today we'll use transformations to prove that certain angle pairs are congruent (equal).

**My prediction:** If I rotate a transversal diagram 180° around the midpoint, I think:

## Quick Check

**Draw two parallel lines cut by a transversal:**
```










```

**Mark two angles that you think might be congruent:**
∠___ and ∠___

**What transformation might map one onto the other?**
