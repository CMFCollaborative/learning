## The Diagram

```
Draw or paste your diagram here:
- Two parallel lines (l and m)
- One transversal (t)
- Label the 8 angles formed











```

**My diagram shows:**
- Line l (parallel line 1)
- Line m (parallel line 2)
- Line t (transversal)
- 8 angles created

## Part 1: Identifying Alternate Interior Angles

### What are "interior" angles?

**Interior angles** are angles that are BETWEEN the two parallel lines.

**In my diagram, the interior angles are:** ∠___, ∠___, ∠___, ∠___

---

### What are "alternate" interior angles?

**Alternate interior angles** are:
- On OPPOSITE sides of the transversal
- Both INTERIOR (between the parallel lines)
- Form a "Z" pattern or backwards "Z"

**In my diagram, the alternate interior angle pairs are:**

**Pair 1:** ∠___ and ∠___
**Pair 2:** ∠___ and ∠___

---

## Part 2: Using Transformations

### Exploring the relationship

**Choose one pair of alternate interior angles:** ∠___ and ∠___

**What transformation maps one angle onto the other?**
- [ ] Translation
- [ ] Rotation (If so, around what point? By how many degrees?)
- [ ] Reflection
- [ ] Combination

**Describe the transformation in detail:**






**Why does this transformation work?**






---

### What does this tell us?

**If the transformation preserves angle measures, then:**




**Therefore, my conjecture is:**

∠___ ≅ ∠___ because...




---

## Part 3: Formal Proof

**Theorem to Prove:** If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then alternate interior angles are congruent.

### Given:
Lines l and m are parallel (l ∥ m)
Transversal t intersects both lines

### Prove:
Alternate interior angles are congruent
Specifically: ∠___ ≅ ∠___

---

### My Proof

**Method: Using Transformations**

**Step 1:** Consider a 180° rotation around point ___ (the midpoint of the segment connecting the two angles' vertices on the transversal)




**Why this is valid:**




---

**Step 2:** Under this rotation:
- Line l maps to ___
- Line m maps to ___
- Transversal t maps to ___




**Why this is valid:**




---

**Step 3:** The rotation maps ∠___ to ∠___




**Why this is valid:**




---

**Step 4:** Since rotations preserve angle measures:




**Why this is valid:**




---

**Conclusion:**

Therefore, ∠___ ≅ ∠___

This proves that alternate interior angles are congruent when parallel lines are cut by a transversal. ∎

## Part 4: Alternative Proof Method

**Can you prove this using the Triangle Angle Sum Theorem instead?**

**Hint:** Create a triangle using the parallel lines and transversal.

**My attempt:**











**Which method do I prefer?**
- [ ] Transformation method
- [ ] Triangle method
- [ ] Both are equally clear

**Why:**

## Part 5: Check My Understanding

### Practice Problem 1

```
[Diagram with parallel lines, transversal, and one angle marked 65°]
```

**If ∠1 = 65° and ∠1 and ∠5 are alternate interior angles, then:**

∠5 = ____°

**My reasoning:**




---

### Practice Problem 2

```
[Diagram with parallel lines, transversal, and one angle marked 110°]
```

**Find all the alternate interior angles:**

∠___ and ∠___ are alternate interior angles
If one measures 110°, the other measures ____°

∠___ and ∠___ are alternate interior angles
If one measures ___°, the other measures ____°

## Reflection

**What I learned:**




**What I'm still wondering:**




**How confident am I with alternate interior angles?**
- [ ] Very confident - I could teach this!
- [ ] Confident - I understand it
- [ ] Somewhat confident - I get the idea but need practice
- [ ] Not confident - I need help
