**Q: What about students without home computers?**
A: Work can be done entirely at school. Git keeps everything in sync.

**Q: How do I grade using Git?**
A: Review commits, check tags for submissions. See TEACHER_WORKFLOW.md for rubrics.

**Q: What about privacy/FERPA?**
A: Use private repositories. GitHub/GitLab support educational privacy requirements.

### For Students

**Q: What if I mess up?**
A: Almost everything can be undone! See the guides for recovery procedures.

**Q: Do I need to be a coder?**
A: No! You're just saving files and writing notes.

## Assessment Integration

### What to Grade

**Process (40%):**
- Commit frequency (consistent effort)
- Commit message quality (metacognition)
- Revision patterns (growth mindset)
- Collaboration (peer teaching)

**Product (60%):**
- Mastery check scores (content knowledge)
- Project quality (application)
- Lab reports (scientific method)
- Participation (engagement)

### How Git Helps Grading

**Evidence of effort:**
```bash
# See how many commits in the last week
git log student-name/main --since="1 week ago" --oneline | wc -l
```

**Quality of work:**
```bash
# Review their actual work
git show student-name/main:Unit3/notes.md
```

**Collaboration:**
```bash
# See peer teaching
git log --all --grep="peer teaching"
```

**Growth over time:**
```bash
# Compare early vs. late work
git diff commit-from-sept commit-from-dec
```
